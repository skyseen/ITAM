# IT Asset Management System - Usage Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Starting the Application

First, make sure Docker is running on your system, then start the application:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd ITAM

# Start all services (database, backend, frontend)
docker-compose up --build

# The application will be available at:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
# - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### 2. Seeding the Database with Sample Data

After the application is running, you need to populate the database with sample data including users with encrypted passwords:

```bash
# Open a new terminal and run the seeding script inside the backend container
docker-compose exec backend python seed_data.py

# Or alternatively, run it directly in the backend container:
docker exec -it itam-backend-1 python seed_data.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Starting database seeding...
Creating sample users...
Created 8 users
Creating sample assets...
Created 12 assets
Creating sample asset issuances...
Created 4 asset issuances
Creating sample notifications...
Created 3 notifications
Creating sample audit logs...
Created 3 audit logs

==================================================
DATABASE SEEDING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
==================================================

Sample Login Credentials:
------------------------------
Admin User:
  Username: admin
  Password: admin123

Manager User:
  Username: manager1
  Password: manager123

Regular User:
  Username: user1
  Password: user123

Note: All user passwords are stored encrypted in the database.
You can now access the application at http://localhost:3000
```

## üîê Understanding Password Encryption

### How Passwords Are Encrypted

The system uses **bcrypt** for password hashing, which is a secure one-way encryption method:

1. **Plain Text Password** ‚Üí `admin123`
2. **Bcrypt Hash** ‚Üí `$2b$12$LQv3c1yqBwEHxPiNW971gOqbdgzdh.vgdMJ8T8jAqVK9sB8zU1aGO`

### Why You Can't Set Passwords Directly in Database

- Passwords are **hashed** (encrypted) using bcrypt with a salt
- The same password creates different hashes each time
- You cannot reverse the hash to get the original password
- Direct database password insertion would not work with the authentication system

### Setting User Passwords Programmatically

If you need to add users with custom passwords, you have several options:

#### Option 1: Modify the Seeding Script

Edit `backend/seed_data.py` and add your users to the `users_data` array:

```python
users_data = [
    {
        "username": "your_username",
        "email": "your_email@company.com", 
        "full_name": "Your Full Name",
        "department": "Your Department",
        "role": UserRole.ADMIN,  # or MANAGER, VIEWER
        "password": "your_password"  # Will be automatically hashed
    },
    # ... existing users
]
```

#### Option 2: Use the API Endpoint

Create users through the API (requires admin privileges):

```bash
# Login to get auth token
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'

# Use the token to create a new user
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -d '{
       "username": "newuser",
       "email": "newuser@company.com",
       "full_name": "New User",
       "department": "IT",
       "role": "viewer",
       "password": "newpassword123"
     }'
```

#### Option 3: Python Script for Password Hashing

Create a simple script to generate hashed passwords:

```python
from passlib.context import CryptContext

pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

# Hash a password
password = "mypassword123"
hashed = pwd_context.hash(password)
print(f"Hashed password: {hashed}")

# Verify a password
is_valid = pwd_context.verify("mypassword123", hashed)
print(f"Password valid: {is_valid}")
```

## üë§ User Accounts and Roles

### Default User Accounts

After seeding, you'll have these accounts available:

| Username | Password | Role | Department | Access Level |
|----------|----------|------|------------|--------------|

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Database Connection Error
```bash
# Check if database container is running
docker-compose ps

# Restart the database
docker-compose restart postgres

# Check database logs
docker-compose logs postgres
```

#### 2. Seeding Script Fails
```bash
# Make sure backend container is running
docker-compose ps

# Check backend logs
docker-compose logs backend

# Run seeding script with verbose output
docker-compose exec backend python -u seed_data.py
```

#### 3. Login Issues
- Ensure you're using the correct credentials from the seeding output
- Check that the database was properly seeded
- Verify the backend is running on port 8000

#### 4. Permission Denied Errors
- Make sure you're logged in with appropriate role
- Admin functions require admin account
- Some features are role-restricted

### Resetting the Database

If you need to start fresh:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Remove database volume (WARNING: This deletes all data)
docker volume rm itam_postgres_data

# Start services and re-seed
docker-compose up --build
docker-compose exec backend python seed_data.py
```
